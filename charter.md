# The Official Charter

## Preamble

It is our belief that in times of turmoil, as well as times of peace, there stands a need for people of like mind and purpose to unite their efforts in order to guard and defend the greater good. To further this cause, the call has often been sounded and we, who have responded, pledge ourselves to a purpose beyond that of personal advancement or gain. We, who once fought alone and who now stand united, seek strength in unity while embracing the individuality in each member. Held together through strength of purpose, we strive to make the lives of all Elanthian citizens safer by providing leadership and valued service to the community.

## Mission Statement

The Order of the Apostles strives to lead, inform, protect, and serve the law-abiding citizens of Elanthia.

## Reason for Founding

In the early years, those adventurers who would become the founding members of the Apostles, began to draw people together to instruct the young, exchange information and strengthen the bonds of community. During the period of time known to some as the Red Winter War, when community resources were pushed to the breaking point, it was quickly realized that without strong leadership the invading forces of the Gorbesh would quickly overcome the defenders of Elanthia. The first members of the Apostles answered this need by organizing patrols, rally points and leading the citizens of Elanthia in repulsing the aggressors.

Once the war had come to an end, it became apparent that the need for leadership did not end in the absence of a common enemy. Quite the opposite became evident over time and led to the formal founding of an order meant to fill this need. The Apostles stand ready to provide leadership in times of war; while continuing to gather the young and teach them the skills needed to thrive in times of peace.

## The Revival

394 years since the Victory of Lanival the Redeemer, with the Outcast War still fresh in our minds and the current threat from beyond the barrier knocking at our gates, a group of adventurers come together in the hopes of reviving this once thriving order. With the revival the group hopes to assist the citizens of Elanthia in repelling the ever present threat of the undead hordes gathering against them.

Once the threat is neutralized the Apostles will continue to be a presence in Elanthia to teach, lead, protect and serve.

## Purpose

While the leadership of the Order is most often felt during times of war, peacetime assessments are constantly made in the name of finding areas of weakness in the defense of the realms as a whole. Furthermore, the Apostles provide invaluable intelligence and reconnaissance, enabling the citizens under its protection to make informed decisions and act in the best interest of Elanthia. All members of the Order are rigorously trained to make full use of their talents, regardless of race or guild standing, to ensure the Elanthian public will have leadership they are able to respect and follow. The Order of the Apostles believes respect can not be demanded nor is it the "right of might". Respect is won through good deeds, friendship and conducting oneself in an honorable fashion. It is something each Apostle assists their fellow members not only to achieve, but maintain.

## Goals of the Order

1. Apostles will dedicate themselves to the education and training of their members, so that each member can realize their true potential, through the sharing of knowledge and experiences.
2. Apostles will also dedicate themselves to providing exceptional information with the Elanthian public.
3. Apostles will be an example to those around us through our strong moral values and will encourage others to do so as well.
4. Apostles will work with Elanthian citizens towards neutralizing any threat against Elanthia.
5. The Apostles will work together with Elanthian citizens towards neutralizing any threat against Elanthia as a whole.

## Coat of Arms/Order Crest

The crest of the Apostles, two swords crossing behind a shield, stands as our symbol of leadership and strength. The shield represents the defense of Elanthia. The white in the body of the shield symbolizes goodness and purity. The thirteen red stars in the field of shield are placed for remembrance of those whose lives poured out on the field of battle defending Elanthia and her gods and goddesses. The two crossed swords characterize wisdom and purpose; that which guide the strike of a weapon. The shield and sword mounted on display declare the readiness and vigilance of an Apostle member.

## Membership Badge

Apostle Members wear the Apostle's Pauldron. The pauldron depicts the Apostles crest: two swords crossing under a white and red shield. The pauldron is worn to state membership within the Apostles and support for the community of Elanthia.

## Mission Statement

As Apostles we believe it is the responsibility of every adventurer to be a change agent in the world around them through acts of service and friendship. We believe that, by our example and dedication to this cause, we will live to see the realization of this goal. The Order of the Apostles differs from most other orders in that we focus on community with one another. We encourage our members to communicate on a regular basis. By networking our knowledge, abilities and resources we are greater as a whole than any one of us could become individually. Both on the fields of battle and off, the Order of Apostles is strengthened and set apart by our shared passion for making the world around us a better place for all to prosper.

Through the use of good deeds, friendship and conducting oneself in an honorable fashion we believe that respect will be won and that true respect cannot be gained through the use of "right of might". This is something each Apostle will assist their fellow members not only achieve, but maintain.

Whether it's dragging, raising, helping equip a young adventurer or giving an old adventurer a place to be needed, healing, hunting, sharing knowledge, or just being a friend when you need one... We're Apostles, it's what we do.

## VIII. Admissions Procedures

An applicant seeking membership in the Order of Apostles must fill out the Apostles application located in the provincial Administrator of Orders office located in each of the major cities of Elanthia or at https://sites.google.com/site/theapostlesorder/home. After they have submitted their application it will be reviewed by the council. The council will then vote on whether to accept or deny the applicant recruit status and assign a mentor. The assigned mentor will notify the applicant upon acceptance as a recruit, if assigned mentor can not make contact then Wolfpack lead will need to make contact. Each recruit will be given a Necromancer Test. Upon passing this test, the recruit period will begin. The recruit period will last a minimum of 30 days. During that time, recruits will work with their mentors to better understand the Order. After 30 days, the mentor will present  the recruit to the council for approval. The applicant must tell the council briefly why they want to become a member of the Apostles and what contributions they wish to offer the Apostles. The mentor should also be prepared to speak about their interactions with the recruit, and give their recommendation. The council will then vote on said recruit, who, upon acceptance, will be formally sworn in by the Speaker.

Mentors and recruits must make an effort to contact each other. Arranging meetings is the responsibility of both the mentor and the recruit. Failure to adhere to this guideline inhibits the recruit and the mentor, as recruits will not be able to learn about the order and what is required of the order and mentors can not get a firm understanding of the recruit for the council.

Should the recruit fail to make an effort to connect with his/her mentor, it is possible that a "NO" vote will result for the recruit joining.

Should the mentor fail to make an effort, he/she can be removed from mentoring recruits, either on a temporary or permanent basis, depending on previous occurrences.

## IX: Disciplinary Actions

A. First and foremost, all members shall always epitomize the values of the Order, and adhere to all governing laws of the province they are currently in. If a member is consistently breaking provincial laws, or behaving in a manner unseemly for a member of the Apostles, he or she will be subject to varying levels of disciplinary action.

B. The Speaker will be responsible for enforcing member disciplinary procedures, unless the Speaker is the subject for disciplinary procedures, in which case the council members will decide on the Speaker's disciplinary action by council discussion and vote. Disciplinary action may be initiated when any member breaks the Apostle bylaws, or as otherwise noted in the bylaws.

C. Disciplinary action consists of three steps:

1. An official verbal warning handed down by Officers or a Council member..

2. An official written warning and/or revocation of privileges such as attendance at Order functions etc.

3. The Speaker, Vice Speaker, and Council Lead  may submit an offending member to the council for a vote on terminating that person's membership. This vote will not occur until at least one week past the offending event or behavior, so no rash decisions will be made. The request for termination can be  withdrawn during this time period.

  Additional measures can be taken along with any of these steps, if deemed necessary. Once a member has their membership revoked they are expected to repay any outstanding debts to the Order or return or replace any borrowed Order property.

4. Council members and officers subject to disciplinary action will forgo previous three rules and will have a 1 write up then grounds for removal, although serious offenses can result in a motion for no confidence vote.

## X. Closing

In closing we hope you will add your strength to ours and find it within yourself to become involved. To pledge yourself to any group is to seek to become more than just one man or woman. You are seeking to be part of some larger picture. Never think that you are too young or inexperienced to start or to make a difference. Many of our members have spent year upon year, rank upon rank, leading and learning, and yet still discover something new everyday. Learning and self-discovery is one gift of being an Apostle. However, the greatest gift comes as a result of interacting with others. The chance to meet and help people will fill you with that warm intangible gift. It is a gift we hope you will accept and share with every person you meet in the cities and wilderness of Elanthia.
